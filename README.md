# Plonk with Commit API solidity verifier

This repository contains an implementation of the [plonk](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953.pdf) verifier with the addition of a custom gate to handle Fiat Shamir in circuit. It follows the [gnark](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnark/tree/develop/backend/plonk/bn254) implementation of the plonk verifier (in verify.go in the previous link) for BN254.

## Example

```bash
go generate ./internal/ 
```
Generates the solidity files in `contracts`, corresponding to the circuit defined in `/internal/main.go` (the circuit doesn't matter). The logic of the code is the same for all circuits, but the constants corresponding to the verification key in `contracts/Verifier.sol` will change from one circuit to another. The proof is hardcoded in `contracts/TestVerifier.sol` for testing only.

```bash
make all
```
Clean `/abi` and `/gopkg` and compiles the contracts in `/contracts`.

```bash
go run main.go
```
Create a simulated evm backend using geth, and call `test_verifier()` in `TestVerifier.sol`. An event is emitted that captures the result. The console should output `true`.

In `TestVerifier.sol`, if any part of the proof of the public inputs is changed, the verification should fail.

## Scope

The files in the scope of the audit are
* contracts/Utils.sol
* contracts/Verifier.sol

All the remaing files except the two above are out of scope.

## Intended Functionnality

`Verifier.sol` follows the gnark's implementation [here](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnark/blob/develop/backend/plonk/bn254/verify.go#L43).

## Code guide

### Naming convention

* All the constants starting with `vk_` are related to the verification key.

* All the constants starting with `proof_`are related to the proof, and correspond to offsets on the `bytes memory proof`.
ex: `add(proof, proof_l_at_zeta)` is a pointer to the part of the proof corresponding the claimed value of the committed polnyomial `l` at `zeta`.

* All the variables and constants having the suffix `_x` or `_y` correspond to coordinates of points on `Bn254(Fp)`, with an exception of `g2_srs_‚â§1,2>_<x,y>_<0,1>` which correspond to points on `Bn254(Fp^2)`. Ex: the variables a:=`g2_srs_0_x_0`and b:=`g2_srs_0_x_1` correspond to the element a*u+b in Fp^2=Fp(u) (following solidity convention).

* The variables and constants starting with `state_` correspond to variables that are used all along the proof verification process. Those variables live in the memory slot starting from the free pointer at `mload(0x40)` (in the scope of the `Verify` function) and ending at `state_last_mem`. The slot  `state_check_var` was used for debugging only.

### Custom gate

Our plonk gates look like this `Q‚ÇóL + Q·µ£R + Q‚ÇòLR + Q‚ÇíO + Q‚Çñ + ‚àë·µ¢Qcp_{i‚àà I}Pi_{i}`. In the regular plonk (from the [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953.pdf) ) the last term (`‚àë·µ¢Qcp_{i‚àà I}Pi_{i}`) does not appear.

The differences of our verification algorithm from the original paper are:
* the computation of the public inputs
* the computation of the linearised polynomial

The goal of those custom gates is to enable efficiently Fiat Shamir heuristic in circuit.

When in a cryptographic protocol a verifier has to send to a prover a random challenge, the prover can simulate the process by hashing the data corresponding to the current state of the protocol. The hash function ensures that the challenge is unpredictible (random oracle model) and the fact that the hash is done on the current state of the protocol simulates the fact that the verifier sends the challenge precisely at this step of the protocol.

To implement Fiat Shamir in a protocol written in a gnark circuit we can follow the previous method. Problem: the hash function could be very costly if the state contains a lot of data. A workaround for this issue is to use a custom gate, whose associated wires are the wires describing the state of the underlying protocol requiring Fiat Shamir. The prover will have to commit to those wires (in the same way that he commits to L, R, O). Those commitments are the `Pi_{i}` described above. Then the challenge will be the hash of the commitment to the given wires. The hash yields another public input, that is computed out of the circuit, both by the prover and the verifier. The hash used is implemented in `Utils.sol` in `hash_fr`. The use of the hash function ensures that the challenge is unpredictable. To guarantee that at least all the wires representing the state of the underlying protocol are used (to ensure that the challenge is not computed prior to some sensitive data), we use selector polynomials, which are public, and are denoted `Qcp_{i‚àà I}` above. Say the current state of the protocol on which Fiat Shamir is used contains the wires i‚àà J. Then the associated selector column (which we recall is public) will be `[0, 0,.., 1, .. ,0]` where the 1's appear only on entries i‚àà J. The `Q‚Çó` column contains -1's on entries i‚àà J. The i-th constraint (where i‚àà J) in fact looks like this:
`-1 x w_i + 1 x w_i`. The commitments to `L` and `Pi_{i}` corresponds to polynomials whose evaluation at `g‚Å±` yield both `w_i`. Therefore the constraints `Q‚ÇóL + Q·µ£R + Q‚ÇòLR + Q‚ÇíO + Q‚Çñ + ‚àë·µ¢Qcp_{i‚àà I}Pi_{i}` hold everywhere on the set of n-th roots of 1 (n=number of constraints). Since `Q‚Çó` and `Pi_{i}` are public, the fact the `Pi_{i}` contains at least the relevant wires to the underlying protocol is guaranteed by the copy constraint argument of plonk. The actual challenge is `hash_fr(Pi_{i})` and is computed out of the circuit by both the verifier and the prover. The resulting hash, which is the challenge of Fiat Shamir, becomes now a public input, that is handled exactly as the other regular public inputs of plonk (that is it is used in the sum of Lagrange times the corresponding public input in the plonk verificiation protocol). If the plonk proof passes, it means that the prover indeed computed the challenge as the `hash_fr` of `Pi_{i}`, so the verifier is convinced that the challenge cannot have been maliciously created by the prover, and the challenge does depend on the relevant wires.

#### Functions

* `derive_gamma_beta_alpha_zeta` : corresponds to l.48 to l.80 of [gnark](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnark/blob/develop/backend/plonk/bn254/verify.go#L92).

* `compute_pi` : corresponds to l.92 to l.135 of [gnark](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnark/blob/develop/backend/plonk/bn254/verify.go#L92). We actually compute 
`‚àë_{i<n} pi_{i}L·µ¢{Œ∂}`, with `L·µ¢(Œ∂) = œâ‚Å±/n(Œ∂‚Åø-1)/(Œ∂-œâ‚Å±)` in a first step.  Then we add to this sum `‚àë·µ¢L_{i‚àà I}Hash(Pi_{i})`. `I` here is a set of indices (obtained with `load_vk_commitments_indices_commit_api`) corresponding to the position of new public inputs derived from hashing the commitments contained in `add(proof, (mul(openings_selector_commits,0x20)))`. The hash function that is used is described [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve-06#section-5.2), with the output size hardcoded to 1 and the string hardcoded to "BSB22-Plonk". The hash function is in `contracts/Utils.sol` (the go counterpart is in [gnark-crypto](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnark-crypto/blob/master/ecc/bn254/fr/element.go#L744)).

* `compute_alpha_square_lagrange` computes `Œ±¬≤1/n(Œ∂‚Åø-1)/(Œ∂-1)` and stores it in the state (the value is reused several times)

* `verify_quotient_poly_eval_at_zeta` corresponds to l.137 to l.176 [here](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnark/blob/develop/backend/plonk/bn254/verify.go#L137). This part checks that the following equation holds:
```
l(Œ∂)Ql(Œ∂)+r(Œ∂)Qr(Œ∂)+r(Œ∂)l(Œ∂)Qm(Œ∂)+o(Œ∂)Qo(Œ∂)+Qk(Œ∂)+‚àë·µ¢Qc_{i}(Œ∂)Pi_{i}(Œ∂) + 

Œ±[ Z(ŒΩŒ∂)(L(Œ∂)+Œ≤Œ∂+Œ≥)(R(Œ∂)+uŒ≤Œ∂+Œ≥)(O(Œ∂)+u¬≤Œ≤Œ∂+Œ≥)
 - Z(Œ∂)(L(Œ∂)+Œ≤ œÉ‚ÇÅ(Œ∂)+Œ≥)(R(Œ∂)+Œ≤ œÉ‚ÇÇ(Œ∂)+Œ≥)(O(Œ∂)+Œ≤ œÉ‚ÇÉ(Œ∂)+Œ≥)] +

Œ±¬≤L‚ÇÄ(Œ∂)(Z(Œ∂)-1) = (Œ∂‚Åø - 1)H(Œ∂)
```

* `fold_h`folds the commitment to H (cf [gnark](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnark/blob/develop/backend/plonk/bn254/verify.go#L178))

* `compute_commitment_linearised_polynomial` computes the full commitment of the linearised polynomial digest (cf [gnark](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnark/blob/develop/backend/plonk/bn254/verify.go#L190))

* `compute_gamma_kzg`, `fold_state`: those functions correspond to the `FoldProof` function of the Kzg package in gnark-crypto (see [gnark](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnark/blob/develop/backend/plonk/bn254/verify.go#L232)).

* `batch_verify_multi_points` corresponds to [gnark](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnark/blob/develop/backend/plonk/bn254/verify.go#L253), where here in solidity the number of proofs to fold is hardcoded to 2. The algo also corresponds to section 3.1 of the [plonk paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953.pdf).

## Risks

If any of the public inputs (see contracts/TestVerifier.sol) or the proof (see contracts/TestVerifier.sol), the proof should not pass.
